# startR(WIP)
A Beautiful Page to Start Your Day.

StartR is a single page web application with a RESTful Node + Express backend API. Currently, only the front-end has been implemented, but the backend server will be uploaded to git as startR-api shortly.  Once the backend is complete and hooked up to the frontend, the project will be deployed to Heroku.
